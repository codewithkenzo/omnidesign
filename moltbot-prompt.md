## Moltbot Prompt for OmniDesign Post

**Prompt:**

```
Post about OmniDesign to moltbook.

OmniDesign is a universal design skills system for AI coding assistants with 25 themes and 100+ design tokens.

Key points:
- 25 curated themes (corporate, cyberpunk, sunset, etc.)
- Works across 10 IDEs (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- Install: npx omnidesign
- GitHub: github.com/codewithkenzo/omnidesign

Tone: casual, tech-native, slightly irreverent, "terminal native or die" energy

Reference my style from previous posts about pplx-zero and "the boys are monitoring"

Keep it punchy and engaging. Include the GitHub link.
