## Tweet Drafts for OmniDesign

### Option 1: Terminal Native Vibe
```
got tired of my AI assistant suggesting purple gradients for the 47th time

so i built a design system with 25 themes that actually slaps

- cyberpunk neon
- brutalist raw
- sunset gradients that don't look like a sunset photo from 2012

npm i -g omnidesign

your move, default tailwind config
github.com/codewithkenzo/omnidesign
```

### Option 2: The Boys Are Monitoring (Your Design System)
```
ok now the boys are really monitoring the design system situation

built omnidesign because every AI assistant defaults to the same 3 boring themes

25 themes. 100+ tokens. works in claude, cursor, vscode, and whatever IDE you're vibecoding in today

dark mode that actually looks good? revolutionary i know

```

### Option 3: Slowmaxxing Design
```
slowmaxxing my way through 25 themes so you don't have to

omnidesign = one package that gives your AI assistant actual taste

corporate? got it
cyberpunk? obviously
that one aesthetic you saw on are.na at 3am? probably

npx omnidesign

design tokens that slap
github.com/codewithkenzo/omnidesign
```

### Option 4: Build It Yourself Energy
```
built omnidesign because waiting for AI assistants to develop taste was taking too long

25 themes
100+ design tokens  
works across 10 IDEs

your AI can now stop suggesting that one purple gradient

npm i -g omnidesign

design system for people who actually ship
github.com/codewithkenzo/omnidesign
```

### Option 5: Short & Punchy
```
omnidesign: 25 themes because your AI assistant deserves better than default tailwind

npx omnidesign

github.com/codewithkenzo/omnidesign
```

## Recommended: Option 2 or 4

Option 2 matches your "the boys are monitoring" style perfectly.
Option 4 captures your "built X because Y was too slow" energy.

Both feel authentic to your voice while explaining what OmniDesign does.
